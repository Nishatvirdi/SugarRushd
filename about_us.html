    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there! 👋 Welcome to SugarRush'd, the cozy little corner where sugar, smiles, and good vibes come together.
      Our journey started with a simple idea: to make sweets that spark joy — not just in your taste buds, but in your
      heart.

      We believe baking is an art and happiness is an ingredient that never runs out. From creamy cupcakes to gooey
      cookies and dreamy pastries, every treat is handcrafted with love, a sprinkle of fun, and just the right amount of
      magic.

        Our philosophy is simple: “Life’s too short for boring desserts!” 🍰💛
        We’re not just baking for the sweet tooth — we’re creating moments, stories, and memories that you can share
        with friends, Insta your way into, or just enjoy with your favorite playlist.So, whether you’re here for a quick
        sugar rush, a sweet selfie, or a story to tell, SugarRush'd is your happy place. Because here, every bite comes
        with a sprinkle of joy. 🌈

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Once upon a sprinkle… in 2025, SugarRush'd was born from a tiny kitchen, a big dream, and a love for all
        things sweet. What started as experimenting with cupcakes and cookies quickly turned into a full-blown sugar
        adventure!

        Our mission? Simple: bring joy, fun, and a little magic to every bite. Every pastry, every cake, every cookie is
        made with love, a pinch of creativity, and just enough sweetness to make your day brighter.

        Here, we believe desserts aren’t just food—they’re little happy stories you can taste, share, and remember.
        Because life’s better with sprinkles on top! 🌈✨
